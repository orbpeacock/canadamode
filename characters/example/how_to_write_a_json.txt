The motivation of a character json file is that it describes the parts of an image, and how they connect on their parent images.
The parts can have different states too that move the positions of their child parts.
For example a character might have:
    A body with sockets for 2 arms and a head. It has 3 states: Neutral, Arms raised, or Pointing to the left
    A left arm that connects its shoulder to the body
    A right arm that connects its shoulder to the body
    A Head that connects its middle-bottom to the body. It has sockets for 2 eyes, a nose, and a mouth. It has 3 states: Facing Left, Facing Center, and Facing right
    A left eye that has a state for open and for closed
    A right eye that has a state for open and for closed
    a nose
    a mouth that has states for closed, 50% open, and 100% open

Glossary of terms used here:
"Image_element": A Python object that is mainly an image with position info and a number of other special attributes.
"Position Tuple": A 2-item list [] of numbers from 0 to 1 representing percent of the object's height/width. eg [0, 0] is the upper left, [0.5, 0.5] is the middle
"Socket": The place on a parent object where its child will connect

Anatomy of the JSON file:

The base level of a character json is a dict {} which contains:
    window_size (optional): The size of the window. (uses default settings if not set)
    bg_color (optional): The color of the background. (uses default settings if not set)
    fps (optional): The FPS that this character should update at. (uses default settings if not set)
    volume_range: A two-item list that contains the quietest volume that counts as speaking, and the volume that counts as 100% volume. Eg, [0.3, 1.0] (Uses default settings if not set)
    image_elements: list [] of Image_element dicts {}. You'll need an image element for every piece of the complete character. Eg, body, head, left_eye, right_eye, nose, mouth, left_arm, right_arm

        Each Image_element dict contains:
        name: A string to refer to this Image_Element. Other Image_elements may use this to find it
        states: a list [] of state dicts {}. This has to exist even if it only has one state

            Each state dict contains:
            state_name: A string to refer to this state when switching states.
            image_path: A string that tells where to find the image file. Can be absolute or relative to the root chattyface folder.
            parent_attachment_point: a dict {} that represents the point on this image that connects to the parent. It contains:
                position_on_self: The Position Tuple on this image that connects to a point on the parent.
                parent_name: The name of the parent Image_element. Any invalid name (eg, a blank or a name that doesn't exist) will assume you mean the screen/window/background
                position_on_parent (optional): The Position Tuple on the parent that the position_on_self Position Tuple will line up with. If not included, it will try to attach to a socket for this part. If all else fails, it will go to the center.
            child_sockets (optional): A list [] of Socket dicts {} for child parts to connect to. 
                Each socket dict contains:
                child_name: The name of the child Image_element that will connect to this socket
                position_on_self: The Position Tuple on this image where the socket will be
